# JSON-Reading
Using JS to read a JSON data file for output to a webpage
---
- I learnt how to fetch data from a JSON file including strings and image paths.
- *Note: I used my 'Carousel' Repo as a template for the JS file*

I think that this method is more sophisticated as you can add data entries to the JSON file and the website will update to reflect this automatically due to the js file written. There is no need to update the html file creating a new div for each entry which would result in having to add classes to each div and having functions loop for longer. This new method has one loop to create the initial array and no messing with classList. :slightly_smiling_face:
